# ❤️ Heart Disease Analysis Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of heart disease survival statistics based on various factors such as age, gender, serum creatinine levels, ejection fraction, smoking habits, high blood pressure, diabetes, and anaemia. It is designed to offer clear insights for healthcare professionals, analysts, and researchers.

## 📈 Key Visuals & Insights

1. ### 🧬 Survival Count & Serum Creatinine by Age Group
   - Shows the count of survivors across different age groups.
   - Plots the average serum creatinine level for each group, identifying abnormal kidney function that may affect heart disease prognosis.

2. ### 💓 Survival Count & Ejection Fraction by Age Group
   - Displays average ejection fraction values (heart's pumping efficiency).
   - Correlates these values with the number of survivors in each age group.

3. ### 📉 Survival Rate by Age Group
   - Highlights the declining survival rate with increasing age.
   - Highest survival observed in the 61–70 age group (75.90%).

4. ### 🧪 Impact of Risk Factors
   - Assesses the presence of:
     - Smoking
     - High Blood Pressure
     - Diabetes
     - Anaemia
 

5. ### 👥 Gender-wise Analysis
   - Gender-specific filtering available for comparison between female and male survival data.
